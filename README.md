## 📘 Project Overview  
This project verifies the **I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)** protocol using **SystemVerilog** within a **UVM-based verification environment**. The main objective was to test master-slave communication, timing accuracy, acknowledgment responses, and reliable data exchange between devices.

---

## 🔍 Key Features  
- Designed a **UVM testbench** for functional verification of the I2C protocol.  
- Verified **start/stop conditions**, **ACK/NACK responses**, and **data transfers**.  
- Implemented **random stimulus generation** for coverage-driven testing.  
- Strengthened understanding of **waveform debugging**, **coverage analysis**, and **verification methodology**.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used  
- **Language:** SystemVerilog  
- **Verification Methodology:** UVM  
- **Simulation Tool:** EDA Playground  
- **Waveform Analysis:** EDA Playground Integrated Viewer  

---


✅ **Summary of Results**
- Most of the active test cases **PASSED** successfully.  
- The verification environment achieved **93.75% functional coverage**.  
- Verified correct data transfer, acknowledgement handling, and protocol control flow.

---

## 🏁 Conclusion  
This project provided hands-on experience with **protocol-level verification**, **UVM environment creation**, and **SystemVerilog-based testbench design**.  
The simulation results confirm the correct behaviour of the I2C master-slave communication with near-complete coverage, demonstrating a strong understanding of **industry-standard verification practices**.
